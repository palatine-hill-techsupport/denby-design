                        <p><strong>The Why:</strong> Our team invested considerable time and effort into conducting surveys for many of the jobs completed by our subcontractors across Australia. However, there was no clear process or policy for reviewing these jobs. Each person approached their work in their own way, resulting in data that was often unusable. As a result, the management team never checked or used it, making it a big waste of time.</p>                       
                        <p><strong>The How:</strong> We needed to establish a standard that all stakeholders could agree on. Fortunately, there was a pre-existing rate card that was regularly negotiated between the management team and the subcontractors. This card included very clear, mandatory minimums for every service, which became the foundation for the first version of the web app.</p>
                        <p><strong>The Outcome:</strong> The unified data that the tool generated was a hit, and the actionable statistics it provided could now be used for meaningful reporting. However, the feedback from the team mostly focused on the UI. When a new cohort was hired, they wanted some UI adjustments to make their UX more of a learning experience as well. So, we made those changes and even added a ‚ÄúPro Mode Toggle‚Äù to keep the old UI as an option.</p>
                        <p>Ultimately, the success of this project was so significant that our Salesforce admin adopted my code and consultations to build the audit tool within Salesforce itself. It‚Äôs now a fully integrated feature in our daily workflow, providing real, usable data.</p>

                        <p><strong>The Why:</strong> ‚ÄúThe traditional path for students learning skills in fields like three-dimensional (3D) design and animation, user experience (UX) and web design, film and video, and game design is to seek employment in studios that develop outcomes for entertainment or marketing. The skills acquired in these fields are highly advanced, technically impressive, and increasingly valued across a wide range of industries beyond the traditional ‚Äòcreative‚Äô sectors. These industries offer a variety of exciting and complex interdisciplinary opportunities where digital creative specialists can apply their expertise.‚Äù</p>
                        <p><strong>The How:</strong> I didn‚Äôt make it easy on myself. I wanted to create something that specifically used UX as the guiding principle, focused on Australia, and targeted an area where UI/UX design could add significant value. I was captivated by the idea of taking an outdated mess of education services within Australia‚Äôs oldest government department and unifying them into something that would make the day-to-day lives of regular people a little easier.</p>
                        <p><strong>The Outcome:</strong> One aspect I was particularly proud of was how I dug into the authors' LinkedIn profiles for additional insights into the project. I also made great use of the Wayback Machine to explore old versions of the NSW education platform and understand the context from which the designers were working.</p>

                        <p><strong>The Why:</strong> ‚ÄúA web page is dynamic when it connects to an online database, retrieves or inputs data, and presents it in HTML. This ability revolutionized the web, making dynamic pages a core feature of web-based business, education, and social platforms. PHP and MySQL enable this functionality and are used in over 78% of websites for dynamic data delivery (*W3Techs report). Mastering these languages and platforms gives you the foundational skills for working with data-driven web frameworks and CMS.‚Äù</p>
                        <p><strong>The How:</strong> I dove right into this one. I immediately knew which online storefront I wanted to replicate in PHP, backed by MySQL. It was also my first time working with Docker, instead of using JSON as a database. After quickly getting the container up and running, I found it surprisingly intuitive ‚Äì perfect for anyone who‚Äôs developed on the web or spent too many hours in Excel.</p>
                        <p><strong>The Outcome:</strong> I wanted to do more than just pulling data into an array and filling slides with it, so I leaned into a current trope in the gaming landscape and built a loot box system. It turned out even better than I‚Äôd hoped, except for the low-resolution images. When I submitted it, I claimed the low res was intentional for space optimization‚Ä¶ and not because they came from a certain popular gaming store.</p>

                        <p><strong>The Why:</strong> ‚ÄúThe lettermark addresses both mnemonic and legibility issues. It is simple, unique, and instantly recognizable. However, lettermarks must be carefully designed and thoroughly considered across different scales and applications to be effective identifiers. This assessment asks me to develop a personal lettermark that will serve as the foundation of my brand identity as a designer.‚Äù</p>
                        <p><strong>The How:</strong> Unlike the meme, graphic design isn't my passion. But like the meme, it shows in my designs. I have immense respect for those who've mastered Illustrator. I've always been jealous of those who can use styluses to effortlessly bring ideas to life in a digital space for people like me to use. But vectors are magic, and this project is a good example of why I‚Äôll never continue developing my Illustrator skills.</p>
                        <p><strong>The Outcome:</strong> Growing up in the '90s and early 2000s, that influence came through in my final product. It features elements of the grunge aesthetic from that era, alongside the maximalism that emerged in the next decade. I‚Äôm proud of this effort, especially when I compare it to anything I exported from Illustrator before this.</p>

                        <p><strong>The Why:</strong> The second of two early projects for DCX101 - Design Context, aimed at showcasing creative expression through a digitally made collage. I chose to use web design as the medium to continue developing that skillset.</p>
                        <p><strong>The How:</strong> After reading <em>The Smartest Guys in the Room</em> by McLean and Elkind (2003), I found key data points that tracked Enron's stock price. I also used Google Scholar to gather relevant newspaper clippings, which formed the basis of the collage.</p>
                        <p><strong>The Outcome:</strong> I‚Äôm really happy with how the articles animate across the page and the story the timeline tells as it unfolds. My goal was to keep it simple, yet impactful, and I hope it visually encapsulates the highs and lows of Enron‚Äôs fascinating story.</p>

                        <p><strong>The Why:</strong> This was the first of two early projects for DCX101 - Design Context. With almost no restrictions, we were tasked with creating a visual metaphor for the concept of "curiosity." As always, I chose web design to keep the project aligned with my studies and set myself a challenge.</p>
                        <p><strong>The How:</strong> The process didn‚Äôt require much research, but while creating a mood board, I came across an amazing artwork on DeviantArt featuring Alice slipping down the rabbit hole. I knew immediately it had to be the focal point of the project.</p>
                        <p><strong>The Outcome:</strong> As a UX/UI developer in training, I‚Äôm always thinking about how to make features responsive and interactive to engage the user's curiosity. To truly embody the concept of curiosity, I wanted to reward it rather than coax it. This posed an interesting challenge, and I‚Äôm happy with the final result. Once you figure out the trick, the concept is clear, but the site will only function for the curious.</p>

                    <p><strong>The Why:</strong> ‚ÄúThis assessment focused on enhancing front-end web design skills by creating a responsive webpage for a client. I designed and coded a second webpage using HTML and CSS, incorporating mobile responsiveness, jQuery functionality (like a hamburger menu), and user input. The project involved creating wireframes, coding a sophisticated layout, and ensuring the site worked seamlessly across devices. The goal was to optimize interaction design, ensuring menus, images, and forms adapted to various screen sizes while maintaining a user-friendly experience.‚Äù</p>
                    <p><strong>The How:</strong> Not only was this my crash course in using the incredible tool that is Figma, but it was also the first time none of the planning was done entirely in my head. From building personas and sketching wireframes on paper to experimenting with Figma and finally bringing it all together in code, this felt like my closest experience to completing a full agile sprint. I really enjoyed every step of the process, and as a huge music fan, I‚Äôve always admired the creativity behind festival posters, so I hope my enthusiasm for the project comes through in the design.</p>
                    <p><strong>The Outcome:</strong> ‚ÄúProper planning prevents poor performance‚Äù is something I‚Äôve always been taught, and getting to iterate my design vision through each stage really reinforced that lesson. I‚Äôm proud of the vibe I managed to capture in my design and the UI improvements that became evident when transitioning from Figma to code. Initially, I was given a single image to work with, and I used AI tools to extrapolate a looped video from it. The red haze from this video became the defining feature of the site. Figma was a fun learning curve, and by the end, I had learned enough that I wanted to redo the whole thing, but it also informed my subsequent designs in the program and grew stronger with each iteration.</p>

                    <p><strong>The Why:</strong> Building the ability to think involves using hands-on activities to generate ideas and resolve designs. This project introduced the attributes of materiality and encouraged me to reimagine creation through making. By exploring creativity and developing design skills with paper manipulation, I created digital representations, building toward Assessment 3. This final task involved crafting a model or sculpture that tells a story through craft, drawing on the skills I developed throughout the subject.</p>
                    <p><strong>The How:</strong> Physical art is something I adore but has always been something I appreciate from others and do only as a hobby. So, when tasked with experimenting with paper sculptures, I, of course, decided to approach it through the lens of web design. I was inspired during my research on the recently released James Webb Space Telescope images, which I see as capturing the Foundations of Existence.</p>
                    <p><strong>The Outcome:</strong> The minimalist sculpture work explores a maximalist concept by being enhanced in the web design medium. The James Webb Space Telescope images are animated with CSS and JS, and the same techniques are used to animate the sculptures themselves, making the entire end product feel alive.</p>

                    <p><strong>The Why:</strong> This subject explored the connection between materials and storytelling, focusing on how design can convey meaning through experimentation. In this final task, I applied my knowledge and skills to create and present my completed project, which ranged from product or fashion garments to branding, or even an artistic exploration of my own story.</p>
                    <p><strong>The How:</strong> If the physical art I created in <em>Foundations of Existence</em> was me learning to crawl, this next project required me to jump up into a headlong sprint. It was a much more involved physical piece, but still delivered through my favourite medium‚Äîenhanced and animated through web design. The whole project centered around the concept of Harmony. While researching, I stumbled upon Alan Watts' <em>The Way of Zen</em> (1957), which became a cornerstone of the project.</p>
                    <p><strong>The Outcome:</strong> After much sourcing, sanding, gluing, composing, and keyframing, I‚Äôm absolutely wrapped with how it all came together. The synthwave filters enhance the animated model dancing to the slow, windy sound effect layered over the lofi music, which makes for a perfect complement to Alan‚Äôs incredible poetry, slowly being revealed and coming to its peak right as the music does.</p>

                    <p><strong>The Why:</strong> This subject covers the fundamentals of creating and developing brands, allowing me to explore branding theory and practice. Through analysis of successful cases, I gained skills to build brand identity and consumer experiences. The assessment also prepared me to tackle briefs with clients or employers, equipping me for future job interviews.</p>
                    <p><strong>The How:</strong> This assessment was a fantastic reason to dive into the Canva research rabbit hole; I‚Äôd been canva-curious for some time. I went through an absolute plethora of articles and videos detailing Melanie Perkins' amazing rise to glory and the story of how a little Aussie company took on an industry many thought had already been conquered.</p>
                    <p><strong>The Outcome:</strong> I‚Äôm really proud of how I‚Äôve woven the brand's identity into the design of the report itself. The content of the report is a comprehensive look at Canva, but it may be a little too biased in its writing to be considered a report rather than a long-winded opinion piece. Overall, I hope it demonstrates my ability to look analytically at a business and its own creative process and identity.</p>

                    <p><strong>The Why:</strong> This subject covers the fundamentals of creating and developing brands, allowing me to explore branding theory and practice. Through analysis of successful cases, I gained skills to build brand identity and consumer experiences. The assessment also prepared me to tackle briefs with clients or employers, equipping me for future job interviews.</p>
                    <p><strong>The How:</strong> We got to choose a client of our own creation and assume much of what they‚Äôd request. The one caveat was that it had to be a retail clothes brand. I went with my local second-hand store that churns out pre-loved wonders every week. By this point, I‚Äôd familiarised myself with Figma much more, and I hope that comes through in the prototype. A lot of work went into refining the colour palette and aesthetics of the site, with custom graphics and features like "Spin the Rack," which aims to replicate the fun of just spinning and grabbing something new.</p>
                    <p><strong>The Outcome:</strong> I would have loved to have had time to animate a custom gif that plays after clicking ‚ÄúSpin the Rack,‚Äù but the functionality is fully there. As is the part I‚Äôm most proud of: the layout and vibe. I think it encapsulates the store well and presents a lot of products and ideas without overcomplicating the UI and UX.</p>

                    <p><strong>The Why:</strong> JavaScript animation libraries enable interactive web animations by triggering CSS animations with JavaScript events. Examples include Pixie.js for HTML Canvas, GSAP for DOM animation, Lottie.js for SVGs, and Three.js for 3D animation. These libraries build on JavaScript, offering familiar development environments for web designers and animators.</p>
                    <p><strong>The How:</strong> This was designed to showcase our ability to animate in JS, but I‚Äôm particularly proud of the concept and execution. Inspired by the ever-captivating bouncing DVD screensaver, I replicated the feel of early video with fonts, colour palette, and of course, the animated text.</p>
                    <p><strong>The Outcome:</strong> I still get a bit lost watching the text bounce, but I‚Äôm even more proud of the fake loading bar, the scan lines animated into everything, the flash effect as the menu comes on and off, and the idea of putting a demo of the project within the project.</p>

                    <p><strong>The Why:</strong> My mother came to me with an idea for a magazine that shared the stories of people and places she cherished in our home, Gippsland. She was our photographer and writer, leaving me to develop all our digital marketing presence, branding, and the layout of the magazine itself.</p>
                    <p><strong>The How & Why:</strong> This was my first go at InDesign, and I couldn‚Äôt have done it without the artistic input of my mother. The product we came out with sold really well both back in the country at a few coffee shops and a few magazine retailers here in Melbourne. Unfortunately, life events stopped her from being able to capitalise on the dream of continuing, but I still regularly thumb through my copy in nostalgic wonder at what we managed to achieve.</p>

                    <p><strong>The Why:</strong> Over a decade ago, when applying to university for the first time, I was working on some projects to fill out my barebones portfolio. While watching <em>Ferris Bueller‚Äôs Day Off</em>, I was reminded of faking notes by my parents to the school when I was very young, and how much better I could have done that with the use of Adobe's creative software.</p>
                    <p><strong>The How & Why:</strong> I had my family each fill out a character sheet, painstakingly traced each letter, and then used open-source software to compile it into TTF files. The attached display posters of each font were printed and block-mounted to hang in the first room I had outside home, to remind me of them.</p>
